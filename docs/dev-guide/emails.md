# Emails

## Using Foundation for Emails with Campaign Monitor

1. Build email using `npm start` (do not build with inliner).
2. Import into Campaign Monitor and check "Inline styles" option.
3. Preview.

Note that inlining styles with Foundation's build script and then importing into Campaign Monitor does not work properly.
